#OptiRoute Mumbai: Genetic Algorithm-based Route Optimization

**Project Overview:**
1. **Route Optimization using Genetic Algorithm:** This project employs a genetic algorithm to find the most optimal path that connects 62 key cities in Mumbai. The genetic algorithm iteratively evolves routes, aiming to minimize the total distance traveled and improve the efficiency of travel between these cities.

2. **Interactive Geographic Visualization:** The project employs the `folium` library to create an interactive and visually engaging map that showcases the optimized path. Users can explore the geographical layout of Mumbai and visualize the optimized routes connecting the Major Cities/Towns.

3. **City-Centric Pathfinding Solution:** By considering Cities/Towns of Mumbai, this project offers a city-centric approach to route optimization. It demonstrates the effectiveness of using genetic algorithms in real-world scenarios, highlighting the potential for efficient travel planning within a densely populated urban environment.
